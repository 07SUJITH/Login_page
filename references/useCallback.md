The `useCallback` hook in React is used to memoize a callback function so that it doesn't get recreated every time the component renders. This is particularly useful when passing callbacks to optimized child components that rely on reference equality to prevent unnecessary renders (e.g., `React.memo`).

 ```javascript
 const handleSubmit = useCallback(async (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    const userCredentials = { username, password };

    try {
      const response = await axios.post('YOUR_API_ENDPOINT', userCredentials);
      console.log(response.data);
      setErrorMessage('');
      // Redirect logic should be handled here
    } catch (error) {
      let errorMsg = 'An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later.';
      if (error.response?.data?.message) {
        errorMsg = error.response.data.message;
      }
      setErrorMessage(errorMsg);
    }
  }, [username, password]);
```
`useCallback` is being used to define the `handleSubmit` function, which is likely used as an event handler for a form submission. The dependencies array `[username, password]` tells React to only recreate the `handleSubmit` function if either `username` or `password` changes. This means that if the component re-renders due to other reasons (like state or prop changes), the `handleSubmit` function will remain the same instance unless `username` or `password` has changed.

Here's a breakdown of what happens in the `handleSubmit` function:

1. It prevents the default form submission behavior using `event.preventDefault()`.
2. It constructs an object `userCredentials` containing the current values of `username` and `password`.
3. It attempts to make a POST request to an API endpoint using Axios with the constructed credentials.
4. If the request is successful, it logs the response data, clears any existing error message, and potentially handles redirection (though the actual redirect logic is commented out).
5. If there's an error, it checks if the error response contains a custom message and sets the `errorMessage` state accordingly.

By using `useCallback`, the `handleSubmit` function is not unnecessarily recreated on every render, which can lead to performance improvements, especially in larger applications or when dealing with frequent re-renders.
